In this segment, we are given the chance to:
  -Interact with PostgreSQL database tables using the SQLPad interface
  -Sort the outputs from a SQL query according to column values
  -Include or exclude table records according to specified conditions
  -Count the number of records in a database table
  -Remove duplicate table records and return only unique values
Which helps us to be familiarized with the most useful SQL techniques for data analysis
